description: "Agent skill manifest for this documentation."

Mintlify hosts a `skill.md` file for this documentation site.

Access it at:

```
https://rivet.dev/docs/skill.md
```

To add it to an agent using the Skills CLI:

```
npx skills add rivet.dev/docs/skill.md
```

If you run a reverse proxy in front of the docs, make sure `/skill.md` and `/.well-known/skills/*`
are forwarded to Mintlify.
