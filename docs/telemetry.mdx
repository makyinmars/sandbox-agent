title: "Telemetry"
description: "Anonymous telemetry collected by sandbox-agent."
---

sandbox-agent sends a small, anonymous telemetry payload on startup to help us understand usage and improve reliability.

## What gets sent

- Sandbox Agent version.
- OS name, architecture, and OS family.
- Detected sandbox provider (for example: Docker, E2B, Vercel Sandboxes).

Each sandbox gets a random anonymous ID stored on disk so usage can be counted without identifying users.

## Opting out

Telemetry is enabled by default in release builds.

Disable it with:

```bash
sandbox-agent server --no-telemetry
```

Debug builds disable telemetry automatically. You can opt in with:

```bash
SANDBOX_AGENT_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1 sandbox-agent server
```
